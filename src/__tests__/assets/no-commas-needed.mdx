Thanks to the advancements in lunch eating technology and a few courageous souls[^eats-lunch-at-ten-fifty-eight], this post can exist without needing to have anything modified. This is quite unlike the somatic cells (which undergo reprogramming) to be used in revolutionary medical therapies[^ipsc-review].
